			<h1 class="page__title">Responsive and Responsible</h1>

			Its key to my web design journey - I dablled with flash, I played around with table based and frame based layouts, but from the moment I began to take web design seriously, responsive design has been such a massive buzz word that its ingrained in everything I do.

I soon began to realise that its all well and good having a responsive layout for a site but often, widgets, plug-ins and embedded code from other sites are not responsive. Responsive content is something that I've been working on during my internship at create.net and it really is suprising how many large content providers (I'm looking at you Youtube!) are not providing responsive content - some have been easy to adapt with a few simple lines of CSS, others have meant a deep dive in to the generated javascript.

My quest for high quality, responsive content has lead to many great discovories and has confirmed that the internet has everything. Twice. For any given task, I can be sure that there will be multiple ways of achieving your goal. Some with jQuery, others CSS only, some responsive, others not etc etc.

Its kickstarted me into choosing, not just the first piece of code that give the desired effect, but the piece that makes most sense to read (For tweaks and editing the github and documentation pages are vital too), the smallest files sizes (for page load times), the most browser compatible and generally - the most responsible.
