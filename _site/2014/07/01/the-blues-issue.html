<p>This band wanted a site that could host far more information than their popular Facebook page.</p>

<p>I tried to stick away from modern flat design trends here as it does not suit the bands blues sound.</p>

<p>Organising the wealth of information whilst keeping the navigation simple was the main challenge here.</p>

<p>The site is built on wordpress and allows the band members to update all content including upcoming gigs.</p>
