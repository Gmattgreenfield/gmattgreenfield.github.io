<p>I'm Matt and I'm a Junior Front End Developer at <a href="https://www.create.net/">create.net</a> in Brighton, UK.<p>
<p>I enjoy creating fast and responsive websites that are focused on the task at hand. In many ways that makes me a generalist, focusing not only on making the code as efficient as possible but also looking at how users interact with a site and the purpose of each element of a site.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of me as a kid, forever constucting things from K'Nex - at times following the instructions to ever last detail, and at others making new creations from scratch. I guess not much has changed since then, I'm just making websites rather than plastic solar powered cars.</p>
<p>When Iâ€™m not working on websites, I enjoy playing my drums in <a href="https://www.thebluesissue.co.uk">my blues band</a>, listening to music of various genres and riding my bike.</p>
