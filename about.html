<p>I am a junior web designer and developer, from Brighton, UK.</p>
<p>For me, web design and development is the coming together of all the hours I spent drawing and building things as a child. Its my grown up lego!</p>
<p>When Iâ€™m not sat at my desk, I enjoy playing my drums in a blues band, listening to music of various genres and riding my bike. </p>
<p>I am currently working as a Junior Designer at create.net.</p>
