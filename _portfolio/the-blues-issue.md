This band wanted a site that could host far more information than their popular Facebook page.

I tried to stick away from modern flat design trends here as it does not suit the bands blues sound.

Organising the wealth of information whilst keeping the navigation simple was the main challenge here.

The site is built on wordpress and allows the band members to update all content including upcoming gigs.
