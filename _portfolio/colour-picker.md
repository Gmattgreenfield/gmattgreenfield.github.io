Challenged with creating a colour picker that doesn't allow for poor colour choices, and a weekend at home alone, I wireframed and prototyped this concept based on "colour collections".

## The Brief
- Sketch and prototype a colour picker, use a prototyping service such as [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com).
- Ensure picking horrible colour combinations is as difficult as possible.
- Allow colour palettes (or collections) that can be shared and uploaded.

## First steps
I began by sketching with a pen and paper, adding notes and requirements for each stage.


## Making it digital
The next step was to get something more refined and so I turned to [Sketch]().

## Prototyping with Marvel
Marvel is a great service that allows Sketch files (or any other images really) to be made it to working protypes, with buttons that move through the images. Its great to able to spend some time playing with the design and user flow before commiting to any code (which can take a lot longer to edit than a Marvel project!). It probably makes more sense when you see it, so...

## ...here it is
You can let me know what you think by sending me a tweet or [joining the discussion on Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/explore/431591/colour-picker).

## Whats Missing?
- I feel maybe I haven't fully fullfilled the brief of making horrible colours hard to select. Maybe it could offer suggested colours based on those you are already using?
- The actually finish working colour picker. It was never my intention to make this though, maybe one day.
