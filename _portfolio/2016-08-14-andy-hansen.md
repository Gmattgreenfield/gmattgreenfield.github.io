I helped Andy out with turning his illustrations in to this parralaxing home page.
I also implemented the magnific popup lightbox, allowing users to click on an image to enlarge it and launch the gallery view.

We decided to try a CSS only paralaxing and it was really interesting to see it in action.
The technique was found here ...... and uses 3d transforms to scale the images based on scroll position.

It's not great in terms of browser support and maybe I would have used a JS library if I was to do it again, however it was great to see how far CSS has come.
