The challenge of building a website template to be used with a content management system (CMS) is one I face regularly in my day to day work.

I was tasked with building an elegant and modern template theme for the Create CMS. That works with a variety of user content, page title lengths, shop options etc.

The site was to be aimed at the wedding and/or jewellery industries. And some basic designs were formed for me to work from. Here's what I made;
