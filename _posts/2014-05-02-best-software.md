Ok, I'd been told Dreamweaver was dead a million times (and I could feel it groaning as I tried the latest CSS3 and HTML 5), but I wasnt really sure what I should be replacing it with. Each recomendation came with features missing from my one-size-fits-all Dreamweaver experience.

I've since learnt that there is a single piece of software to make websites on, a multitude should be used. As of todays date I've settled on the following. I'm sure as hell it will change though!

 - Sublime Text 2 - Just as I've grown used to the shortcuts in this text editor really. I liked Brackets too but habbits die hard I guess.
 - iTerm - for command line things, Github mainly.
 - Mixture - I'm using this a project manager that organizes my projects, compiles and minifies my Sass, optimizes images and provides live previews in Chrome.
 - Google Chrome - The development tools are crucial to how I work, if somethings not how I expected it, I can find the exact line of code thats misbehaving and test edits to it without going back to my text editor.
