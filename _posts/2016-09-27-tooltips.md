I was recently implementing a new set of icons to edit, settings and delete an item.
The icons were to use an icon font and replace images that were not really very easy to understand.
The icons had a title attribute that would show (on some browsers) when hovered but they weren't all that usefull either.
For that reason, I wanted to add some tooltips that would display on hover.
I also wanted the tooltips to be accessable to screen readers.
It struck me that this is a case where accessibility isn't just about disabilty, the icons were hard for anyone to understand without the tooltips.

## How I did
I started with the markup and progressivly enhanced it from there.
You can see here that the HTML makes sense without any CSS.
The relevant aria role attributes have been added to give screen readers an idea of what the elements are doing.

The first level of enhancement was CSS. The tooltip is hidden and then displayed when the icon is hovered, using the `.icon:hover + .tooltip` selector.
The tooltip is positioned above the icon like so;
```
position: absolute;
```
and the arrow is added as an after element using the 'CSS triangle' technique;
```
&:after {

}
```

The trouble with how the tooltips are positioned is that if the screen is not wide enough, it will cut off the tooltip text.
To get around this I saw no other way other than to add to javascript. Enchancement step 2.

The JS works out the screen width, and the position of the tooltips furtherst more right edge.
If the tooltips edge position is bigger than the bodys right position, its overflowing.
A class is added to the tooltip and CSS is used to swing the tooltip the other way.
It's done on hover incase the screen size changes.
